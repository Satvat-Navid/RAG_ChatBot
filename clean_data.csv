All they needed to do was message a technical article they like to the official page of Phoenix on Facebook and accordingly, their articles were posted. The top TWO articles with maximum likes got a point advantage. First Round This was a pen-paper cum visual round. A 20-marks question paper was set, that included 10 questions on logos of popular technical companies and 10 questions based on taglines of popular electronic brands, each question carried 1 mark. The second part of this round involved a video based on emerging technologies shown to the participants, such as 5G technology, Internet of Things, etc., followed by a couple of questions based on the same, each had a weight age of 5 marks. Based on the pre-round and the above stated round, 15 teams having the maximum marks in minimum time were shortlisted for the final round. This round helped the students exercise their brains in finding the appropriate and the most suitable article. This made them go through a variety of new technologies. The paper round tested and enhanced their knowledge about popular companies. Final Round The teams eligible for this round were given a riddle. The solution of the riddle gave the name of a place in the college, for example BB Shed, Canteen, etc. The teams needed to solve the riddle and get to the place. Once they reached the given spot, they were given a sealed envelope. They brought it back to the starting point, without tampering the seal. The catch was such that three teams were supposed to reach one spot, the team reaching first progressed. So, this was a race against time as well as other teams. Once the team reached the starting point, the seal of the envelope was opened. There was another riddle that gave the name of a famous scientist. The team doing both the jobs, bringing back the envelope and deciphering the name of the scientist, in the minimum amount of time secured maximum points. This was followed by a rapid fire quiz having questions from domains like communication, space, embedded etc. The cumulative points of all these parts decided the winner. In case of a tie, another tie-breaker buzzer round was supposed to be conducted but no such situation arose. After a couple of fun-filled days, the following students took the honours: 1st Prize Team ID : 2046 Shivam Jindal EC-3, 3rd year Shikhar Singh EC-3, 3rd year 2nd Prize Team ID : 1001 Paras Narula EI, 2nd year Shivang Maurya ME-3, 1st year 3rd Prize Team ID : 2001 Shashank Shekhar IT-1,1st year Ashutosh Tripathi EN-1, 1st year CO-ORDINATORS :- VIJAYANT SAINI EI 3rd year SOUMYENDRA KUMAR ECE 3rd year 2014-2015 2nd YEAR RECRUITMENT NAME OF EVENT 1 2nd YEAR RECRUITMENT Number of participants 173 Date 1st AUG, 2014 No. of selected students 14 Venue LT complex 1st YEAR RECRUITMENT NAME OF THE EVENT 2 1st YEAR RECRUITMENT No. of Participation 219 Date 8th February, 2015 No. of Student selected 14 Venue LT complex ROBOTRIX WORKSHOP NAME OF EVENT 3 ROBOTRIX WORKSHOP No. Of Participants 523 Date 2nd FEBRUARY, 2015 Venue SEMINAR HALL ROBO FESTINATE NAME OF EVENT 4 ROBO FESTINATE No. of Participants Total team- 106 Total participants- 380 Date 14th MARCH, 2015 Venue AMPHI THEATRE PROCESS PRELIMS Pre round was involved in short listing top 16 teams for the final round in which there were five circular tracks with hurdles and the participating teams who qualified in the least amount of time qualified for the final round.

Additionally, the cell is committed to assisting in the development of value-based policies, ensuring that the principles of ethical and responsible living are embedded in the institutional framework and practices. ABOUT VE CELL- As the twenty-first century unfolds, technological advancements are becoming more evident. Though, on the one hand, the technologies have made our living more comfortable, on the other, it has caused problems at the level of individuals, family , society and the nature at large in the form of stress/strain, psychosomatic diseases, family break-ups, terrorism, wars, anti-people ecology, resource depletion etc. Technological progress has made the degradation of values and ethical conduct evident. It shows that advancements in technology only cannot lead to a happy, prosperous & meaningful life for a human being. Thus, there is a need to progress in developing technologies (learning skills) and inculcate human values, ensuring complementarity between the two. The complementarity will ensure the holistic utilization of technological systems with a holistic worldview gained through value education. A holistic worldview would then ensure ones living in harmony with family, society, and Nature/Existence and help us move towards excellence in all spheres. . To ensure an eco-friendly environment, healthy work culture and to develop a holistic worldview among faculty members, students, staff, and their family members as well as nearby areas, Value Education Cell (VE Cell) was established in AKGEC during the year 2017 under the guidelines of AKTU with the following objectives:  Develop right understanding by sharing the understanding of what to do (Value Education).  Develop right skills by teaching how to do (Technical Education).  Practice right living during the period of education and its continuity.  Living in relationship with other human beings leading to mutual happiness.  Living in relationships with rest-of-nature leading to mutual prosperity and hence ensuring an eco-friendly environment in the campus. In June 2019, AKGEC was upgraded to a Regional Nodal Center. The underlying principle was that besides conducting of Human Value programs in their own institute, a larger number of teachers from surrounding Colleges/Institutes could also attend programs/workshops and become resource persons for the further spread of Human Values education. The journey, so far, has been very satisfying and fulfilling for all. The College has now been recognized as an active nerve center of Value Education by AICTE where faculty members are voluntarily working to spread this education at various levels across the country.

23,"Sustainable Production Centre  Sustainable Production Centre The Sustainable Production Center (SPC) is a startup that was initiated by the Value Education (VE) Cell at AKGEC (Ajay Kumar Garg Engineering College). The center is located at the back of the boy's hostel on the AKGEC campus, covering an area of approximately 27 feet by 18 feet. The center was conceptualized in January 2022, and after a few months of planning, it was finally registered with partnership deeds on July 1st, 2022, with a holistic approach in mind. The primary objective of the VE Cell in establishing the SPC was to create an eco-friendly and people-friendly production center that not only helps reduce the excessive burden of non-renewable resources on nature but also enriches nature and benefits the local community. The center is committed to preparing products using local resources and labor, in a decentralized production system. The initial product line of the center includes handmade soaps made from Aloe Vera and Neem grown on the campus, with three different types available: Aloe Vera Soap, Aloe Vera Soap with Mogra Fragrance, and Neem Soap that works as a natural scrubber. The SPC follows a decentralized production system, which offers numerous benefits. Firstly, the center prepares the soaps locally, reducing transportation costs and saving fuel, which ultimately reduces the burden on nature. Secondly, the center uses bio-degradable polythene instead of traditional packaging materials, thereby reducing the cost of the soap and significantly lessening the burden on nature in terms of fuel, paper, and transportation. Thirdly, the center produces soaps based on need, rather than greed. This means that the center only prepares a second lot of soap when the first lot is sold out, and there is no need to create false advertisements. People who use the soap tell each other about the quality of the product, creating a self-sustaining customer base. Lastly, the SPC employs local people and trains them to prepare the soaps, providing employment opportunities and contributing to the local economy. The center is committed to hiring more local people in the future to produce their products. Overall, the SPC is a positive example of how a decentralized production system can benefit both the local community and the environment. By using local resources and labor, and minimizing packaging and transportation costs, the center is creating a sustainable model for producing high-quality products that are beneficial to both people and nature."

VE cell acknowledges the efforts of the college for Value Education and Value B An Experiential Exploration of Human Values (9-12 March 2023) A four-day UHV activity-based workshop was organized by VE Cell, AKGEC in coordination with ISABS (Indian Society for Applied Behavioral Science) during 912 March 2023 (9 AM  5 PM), in ME Conference Hall. The workshop was facilitated by Dr. Rashmi Saxena & Dr. Rachna Sharma(ISABS Professionals).Indian Society for Applied Behavioral Science (ISABS) is a national, nonprofit voluntary society of behavioral scientists engaged in applying their knowledge and skill to the well-being of persons, organizations, communities, and the society at large. The workshop was planned by Dr. Gopal Babu, Coordinator, VE Cell, AKGEC under. The following faculty members (including Prof. V.K. Parashar, Head VE Cell, AKGEC) actively participated in this small group workshop- FMs from the college FMs from outside Dr. Upasana Mishra, CSE Mr. Bhanu Pratap Singh, AP, CSJMU Kanpur Mr. Akhilesh Verma, CSE Dr. Kumar Sambhav, UPID Noida, NCCIP Member Mr. BN Pandey, CSE Mr. Alok Pandey, KIET Ghaziabad Dr. Parul Verma, ASH Mr. NK Sharma, IMS Ghaziabad Mr. RP Singh, ECE Dr. Vanchna Singh, Self Employed Dr. Jitendra Chaabra, ECE Mr. Himanshu Kumar Rai (Guest Faculty, DU) The following were the highlights of the workshop- It was an unstructured workshop, where the experiential learning was in the Centre. The workshop was specifically focused on observing feelings/emotions of the immediate moment (being aware and honest about  Here and Now). Time, Territory and Task were cautiously cared for, disallowing any past reference or future assumptions ie avoiding Then or There), while interacting and dealing with participants and self-planned tasks. The present was emphasized as the best-owned reality one can see. Self-Image was recognized as a big challenge rather main culprit, responsible for the unawareness about feelings and behavioural ambiguities. Availability of feelings, and acknowledging them, facilitates natural expression in behaviour. The same was exercised. Expression has a CHOICE, may be verbal/nonverbal/pictorial/violent/nonviolent. The same was discussed and experienced. The following were the main observations in the workshop- The process connects with the first step of EXERCISE 1 of UHV, ie seeing the Self by the Self (without any reaction or evaluation). Every moment of awareness about our being was been practiced formally. The process is complementary to developing competence in observing feelings (emotions). The existence (goal) is one similar reality, but the process/mechanism to know/understand the existence is variable. Extracted Recommendations after the workshop were- Integration of efficient steps (from various processes) may be evolved to suit the human desire of KNOWING/ UNDERSTANDING. Participants periodic follow-up (online) is desirable to evaluate the gradual transformation. Frequent such short crisp workshops may be planned, purposely for experiential validation (Steps of Exercise 1 and 2), for intense UHV explorers. This idea was shared with the honorable DG for his kind consideration.

The workshop was conducted by Dr. Akhilesh Verma, Mr. R.P Singh and Dr. Jitendra Chhabra. The workshops objective was to help students to see their innate potential to live a happy life. The problem today is that we fail to understand relationship and feelings (values), and consequently we fail to fulfil it despite all our good intentions. The problems are due to the absence of one or more of the right feelings (values) in the Self. And we try to make up this gap by physical facility or by trying to demand these feelings from others, rather than ensuring these feelings in ourselves and sharing it with others. The workshop was based on an intense exploration of these feelings within, where students validated the proposals in their daily life issues. The facilitators helped them to see the root cause of problems and their solutions, rather than giving any readymade solution. The workshop concluded with self-evaluation and sharing of participating students. The impact factor was rated high and commitment to attend more such transformational workshops was expressed.

Various effective examples include mother-children, friends, spouses, etc., and relationships, which almost every one of us often experiences. Didi also advised everybody to meditate for at least 2-3 minutes between hectic working hours, which certainly boosts productivity, improves mental health, and helps in becoming a better observer of things.

The session ended with the following homework for the audience to contemplate: I have great respect for myself  I am a peaceful, loving, happy, very powerful soul, come what may.

On the second last day, instead of group discussion, a movie was shown to give a basic idea of role of conscious engineering in our daily life to all the explorers. The movie was followed by a light discussion and queries. The last session of the last day of workshop was a sharing session. Explorers were asked to share their experiences, suggest improvements and give feedback related to workshop."

170,"LIFE @ AKGEC  Social Responsibilities  Eco Friendly Environment  Eco Friendly Environment The basic philosophy of AKGEC towards all processes and activities is oriented towards environmental sustenance and eco friendliness. The architecture, design and construction of college building is such that bricks and stones are used maximum and cement plastering is minimal which makes it maintenance free. The architecture of buildings ensures maximum sunlight on all floors. This allows high circulation of natural air and green plantations to flourish inside and outside buildings. The buildings are thermally insulated which keeps the temperature lower in summers and higher in winters, thereby reducing the need for power consumption. Each block and building is surrounded by large open areas on which green lawns, hedges and planters maintain a healthy balance with environment. A network of rain harvesting systems ensure continuous recharging of ground water table. The sewage treatment plant recycles the water filtered through its beds for use of horticulture, green lawns, hedges and plantations of college. There is high focus on conservation of natural resources. Automatic water dispensers are used in toilets / urinals to avoid continuous running of water and ensure its usage when needed. Conservation of electricity is ensured by its usage only when and where needed. Slowly a culture has been built amongst faculty and staff to put off appliances, lights and fans when they leave office. Conservation of electricity is also ensured by use of solar water heaters for providing hot water in all the 6 hostels of the college. A roof top solar power plant of 330 KW capacity has been installed in college campus. This power plant is linked with the electric grid of electricity department where surplus power generated is fed back through a meter installed for this purpose. Conservation of fossil fuels is ensured by making special efforts to co-ordinate and club various trips of vehicles required by different departments and their usage optimised. The waste management area is given high priority. The recyclable garbage waste and non recyclable wastes are dumped in specified containers / dustbins. A separate agency with specialised expertise and dealing in waste collection and disposal has been hired to collect the wastes on daily basis. This company processes the bi-degradable waste to make manure and dispose off cyclable & non-cyclable wastes as per established norms of Government. Optimum usage of natural resources used by mankind is the basic need of the day to maintain required balance in nature This theme is our mantra."""

The session started with a simple breathing exercise which helped the students to feel more relaxed. The light was thrown on the importance of connection i.e having a connection with others that is based on feelings and not on the basis of our thoughts. Communication is the vital key to forming connections with those around us. Observation and Conclusion are the key points in understanding the person we are trying to communicate with. In order to show how these two work, we were shown a short role play where the students enacted out roles, and the rest of the students had to figure out and tell whether the characters were communication on the basis of observation or conclusion. Often, we form opinions/conclusions about others that are irrational on the basis of our past experiences. It is necessary for us to view the situation in the perspective of the present time. Thus, our feelings and how we act upon them are to be taken into consideration as they define our relations with others in the long run. It was an insightful and a marvelous session, the students enjoyed it thoroughly and we look forward to have many more informative sessions. It was an honour to have Dr. Gopal Babu with us and we are grateful to him for enlightening us with his knowledge. 01-03 March 2023 Three Days Offline UHV Workshop for AICTE Officials Resource Person: Dr. Kumar Sambhav, UPID Noida Co-facilitator: Dr. Gopal Babu, AKGEC, Ghaziabad Venue: Head Office, AICTE, New Delhi Nelson Mandela Marg Vasant Kunj Participants: AICTE Officials Dates: 01  03 March 2023 02-04 March 2023 Three Days UHV AICTE Approved FDP from 2  4 March 2023 Resource Person : Mr. Bihari Nandan Pandey, Ajay Kumar Garg Engineering College, Gzb Duration of the program: 03 days Venue: United Group of Institutions (UGI), Naini Participants: Around 50 participants from different technical institutes of Prayagraj and other cities participated in the workshop 23-27 Aug 2022 Five Days offline UHV FDP at RGMCET, Ananthapuramu, Nandyal, Andhra Pradesh Resource Person: Dr. Gopal Babu, AKGEC, Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh Venue of the workshop: Rajeev Gandhi Memorial College of Engineering and Technology (Autonomous) Date of the workshop: 23-08-2022  27-08-2022 Total number of participants registered: 137 Total number of participants attended: 87 26-30 July 2022 Five Days offline UHV FDP at SSEC, Cheenai Resource Person: Dr. Gopal Babu, AKGEC, Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh Venue of the workshop: Sri Sairam Engineering College, Chennai.

256,"Samriddhi Pravaah  Samriddhi Pravaah During the past two centuries, the world has witnessed phenomenal developments on our planet, primarily due to the explosive growth in scientific and technological knowledge. However, it is evident that our modern lifestyle is burdening our Earth. The need to use our natural resources wisely with recyclability is now being felt worldwide. Keeping the above focus in mind, VE Cell at KGEC has taken a small but crucial step towards reducing the burden called 'Samridhhi Pravaah.' The objective of this activity is to strengthen the feeling of prosperity among the in-house AKGEC family members, aligned with the 3R principle: Recognize, Right Utilize, and Recycle to protect Mother Earth. This activity aims to encourage anyone from AKGEC to share their excess resources, including electronic items, stationery, clothes, or any usable articles in good condition, with others. This initiative will undoubtedly reduce the burden on nature. To elaborate, the Samridhhi Pravaah activity is an excellent example of the circular economy in action, where the 3R principle plays a vital role. The first R, Recognize, encourages individuals to recognize the value of the resources they have and identify their excess resources. The second R, Right Utilize, emphasizes that these resources can be used again by others in a better way, rather than being thrown away as waste. Lastly, the third R, Recycle, highlights the importance of recycling these resources to ensure that they are reused as many times as possible and do not contribute to the waste burden on our planet. In conclusion, the Samridhhi Pravaah initiative is a significant step towards sustainability, and it is commendable that VE Cell at KGEC has taken this initiative to encourage the AKGEC family members to share resources and protect Mother Earth. We should all strive to adopt the 3R principle in our daily lives and take responsibility for our actions to ensure a sustainable future for our planet."
